## Birth
At first, my purpose of creating this project was designing a simple graphical user interface;
I wanted to make a PC app that contains a simple GUI and some primary codes...
So I started and when I finished programming, I felt that I can learn a lot of things by developing this program and improve myself, so I started developing and I put it in GitHub.

## Introduction
This PC app called "Average Calculator" can calculate the average of several numbers, no matters how much are they!
This program contains a GUI (Graphical User Interface) designs with Qt and some source codes written with python.

## How to run
To easy run (for the users or someone who wants to test the app), I put the .exe file in the project's folder, you can run the program with just a double-click on that file!
But if you want to develop it or see its source codes, you can open the "runner.py" with your favorite IDE and run it.

## Used tools
- **Programming language**: Python
- **GUI**: Qt5

## TODO
- [x] Add back and forward options.
- [x] Fix a bug related to the program's icon.
- [ ] Put every widgets in an organized table layout.
