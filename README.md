## Birth
At first, my purpose of creating this project was designing a simple graphical user interface;
I wanted to make a PC app that contains a simple GUI and some primary codes...
So I started and when I finished programming, I felt that I can learn a lot of things by developing this program and improve myself, so I started developing and I put it in GitHub.

## Introduction
This PC app called "Average Calculator" can calculate the average of several numbers, no matters how much are they!
This program contains a GUI (Graphical User Interface) designs with QT and some source codes written with python.

## How to run
To easy run (for the users or someone who wants to test the app), I put the .exe file in the project's folder, you can run the program with just a double-click on that file!
But if you want to develop it or see its source codes, you can open the "Average Calculator.py" with your favorite IDE and run it.
Pay attention "Icon.ico" which is the icon of the program and "Average Calculator.py" or "Average Calculator.exe", should be in one folder together; If you're taking a shortcut from "Average Calculator.exe", put the main .exe file next to the icon of the program.

## TODO
- [x] Add back and forward options.
- [x] Fix a bug related to the program's icon.
- [ ] Put every widgets in an organized table layout.
